```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Load tidyverse, read in data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

salmon <- read_csv("salmon_edited.csv")
```

##Explore data

```{r}
salmon_scatter <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = year, y = salmon_fresh)) +
  geom_point()

salmon_scatter

#Overall, the data looks linear. Something seems to have happened around 2004 and 2013 that is non-linear
```

##Linear regression

```{r}
salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)

salmon_model

```

Imports(tons) = -14982940 + 7550(Year)

Slope means the change in salmon imports over time in years.
Y intercept is the initial value for year 0. That's concerning because it is finding the intercept at year 0 instead of during the first year of the data set in the model (1990).
